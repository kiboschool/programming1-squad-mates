# Squad Mates: Instructions

Write a program that creates a list with the names of your squad mates and prints them out.

Create a list using square brackets `[]`. Include the names of your squad mates as strings inside the list.

Print the name of the squad. Then use a `for...in` loop to print out each of the squad member's names.

## Expected Results

The output should look something like:

```
Squad 19, the flying snails:
Keno
Emmy
Rob
Mohammed
Seun
Ope
```

But with your squad instead of the Kibo team.

## Rubric

There are no unit tests for this assignment. You'll have to run your program to see that it's working correctly.
